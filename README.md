# HealthGuard-Covid-19

**Overview:**
HealthGuard is an intelligent system designed to assess the risk of hospitalization for individuals based on key health indicators. The system takes into account crucial factors such as temperature, the presence of chronic diseases, breathing issues, and blood oxygen levels to determine the likelihood of needing hospitalization.

**Key Features:**
1. **Input Variables:**
   - **Temperature:** Patient's body temperature.
   - **Chronic Diseases:** Presence or absence of chronic diseases.
   - **Breathing Issues:** Indication of any respiratory problems.
   - **Blood Oxygen Levels:** Measurement of blood oxygen levels.

2. **Output:**
   - The system provides a binary output, indicating whether the individual is likely to require hospitalization or not.

3. **Decision-Making Process:**
   - The decision-making process is driven by machine learning algorithms, specifically tailored to healthcare scenarios.
   - Utilizes a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to make predictions.

4. **Code Execution:**
   - Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   - Implements machine learning models, such as decision trees or support vector machines, for predictive analytics.
   - The model is trained on historical data to learn patterns and relationships between input variables and hospitalization outcomes.

5. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - The project can be integrated into a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals or individuals to input relevant information easily.

6. **Purpose:**
   - HealthGuard serves as an early warning system, assisting healthcare providers in making informed decisions about whether hospitalization is necessary for a given individual.
   - Aims to optimize healthcare resources by identifying cases where hospitalization may be preventive or necessary.

7. **Benefits:**
   - Enables timely intervention and allocation of medical resources.
   - Enhances patient care by providing proactive health assessments.
   - Contributes to the efficient management of healthcare facilities.

**The code is performing the following tasks:**

1.Loading a dataset related to COVID-19 from a CSV file.<br>
2.Handling missing values by replacing them with the mean for specific columns.<br>
3.Applying one-hot encoding to a categorical variable in the dataset.<br>
4.Label encoding the target variable.<br>
S.plitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).<br>
6.Standardizing the numerical features in both the training and testing sets.<br>
